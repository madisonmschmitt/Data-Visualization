My name is Madison Schmitt and I am a sophomore at Lehigh University. I'm majoring in Journalism with a minor in Marketing as I love to write stories and communicate in various ways. I'm from Long Valley, New Jersey and I grew up with two olders brothers and a yellow lab. I love being active with a specific passion for playing soccer and lacrosse.
